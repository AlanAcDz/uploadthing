# Getting Started with SvelteKit

Make sure you
[install the packages and get your env variables first](/getting-started)

## Package Setup

<Steps>

### Install the packages

import { Tab, Tabs } from "nextra-theme-docs";

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/svelte
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    yarn add uploadthing @uploadthing/svelte
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    pnpm install uploadthing @uploadthing/svelte
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

### Add env variables

```bash copy
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=... # A secret key for your app (starts with sk_live_)
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=... # Your app id
```

<Callout type="warning">
  If you don't already have an UploadThing secret key, [sign
  up](/create-account) and create one from the
  [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Set Up A FileRouter

<Steps>
### Creating your first FileRoute

All files uploaded to UploadThing are associated with a FileRoute. Think of a
FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

```ts copy filename="src/lib/server/uploadthing.ts"
import { createUploadthing } from "uploadthing/server";
import type { FileRouter } from "uploadthing/server";

const f = createUploadthing();

const auth = (req: Request) => ({ id: "fakeId" }); // Fake auth function

// FileRouter for your app, can contain multiple FileRoutes
export const ourFileRouter = {
  // Define as many FileRoutes as you like, each with a unique routeSlug
  imageUploader: f({ image: { maxFileSize: "4MB" } })
    // Set permissions and file types for this FileRoute
    .middleware(async ({ req }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      const user = await auth(req);

      // If you throw, the user will not be able to upload
      if (!user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);

      console.log("file url", file.url);
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof ourFileRouter;
```

### Create a handle hook using the FileRouter

<Callout type="warning">
  Note: This exposes the API route `/api/uploadthing`. Make sure not to create
  an endpoint with the same path.
</Callout>

```ts copy filename="src/hooks.server.ts"
import type { Handle } from "@sveltejs/kit";
import { uploadRouter } from "$lib/server/uploadthing";

import { createServerHandler } from "uploadthing/server";

const utHandlers = createServerHandler({
  router: uploadRouter,
});

export const handle: Handle = ({ event, resolve }) => {
  if (event.url.pathname.startsWith("/api/uploadthing")) {
    if (event.request.method === "POST") {
      return utHandlers.POST(event);
    }
    if (event.request.method === "GET") {
      return utHandlers.GET(event);
    }
  }
  return resolve(event);
};
```

If you need multiple handle hooks in your application take a look at the
[sequence](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#sveltejs-kit-hooks-sequence)
helper function from SvelteKit.

### Creating the UploadThing Helpers (optional)

Generating the `createUploader` helper lets you pass your generic `FileRouter`
once and then have typesafe uploaders everywhere, instead of having to pass the
generic everytime you call `createUploader`, but you can also import it directly
from `@uploadthing/svelte`.

Generating the `useUploadThing` helper function lets you create your own
components.

```ts copy filename="src/lib/utils/uploadthing.ts"
import { generateSvelteHelpers } from "@uploadthing/svelte";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "../server/uploadthing";

export const { createUploader, useUploadThing } =
  generateSvelteHelpers<OurFileRouter>();
```

### Use the FileRouter in your app

The `@uploadthing/svelte` package includes an "Uploader" component that you can
simply drop into your app, and start uploading files immediately. To create the
"Uploader" props you can use the "createUploader" helper. Make sure to pass your
generic `FileRouter` to this function if you're importing it directly from
`@uploadthing/svelte`.

```svelte copy filename="src/routes/+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import { createUploader } from "$lib/utils/uploadthing";

  import { Uploader } from "@uploadthing/svelte";

  const uploader = createUploader({
    endpoint: "withoutMdwr",
    onClientUploadComplete: (res) => {
      console.log(`onClientUploadComplete`, res);
      alert("Upload Completed");
    },
    onUploadError: (error: Error) => {
      alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
    },
  });
</script>

<main
  class="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center gap-16 p-24"
>
  <Uploader {uploader} />
</main>
```

You can also choose to use the "UploadButton" and "UploadDropzone" components
separately. Both are included in the `@uploadthing/svelte` package.

```svelte copy filename="src/routes/+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import { createUploader } from "$lib/utils/uploadthing";

  import { Uploader } from "@uploadthing/svelte";

  const uploader = createUploader({
    endpoint: "withoutMdwr",
    onClientUploadComplete: (res) => {
      console.log(`onClientUploadComplete`, res);
      alert("Upload Completed");
    },
    onUploadError: (error: Error) => {
      alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
    },
  });
</script>

<div class="ut-flex ut-flex-col ut-items-center ut-justify-center ut-gap-4">
  <span class="ut-text-center ut-text-4xl ut-font-bold">
    {`Upload a file using a button:`}
  </span>
  <UploadButton {uploader} />
</div>
<div class="ut-flex ut-flex-col ut-items-center ut-justify-center ut-gap-4">
  <span class="ut-text-center ut-text-4xl ut-font-bold">
    {`...or using a dropzone:`}
  </span>
  <UploadDropzone {uploader} />
</div>
```

Or you can create your own components using the `useUploadThing` helper
function.

```svelte copy filename="src/routes/+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import { useUploadThing } from "$lib/utils/uploadthing";

  const { startUpload } = useUploadThing("videoAndImage", {
    onClientUploadComplete: () => {
      alert("Upload Completed");
    },
  });
</script>

<input
  type="file"
  on:change={async (e) => {
    const file = e.currentTarget.files?.[0];
    if (!file) return;

    // Do something with files

    // Then start the upload
    await startUpload([file]);
  }}
/>
```

</Steps>

## Theming Svelte components

Check out our [theming guide](/theming) to know the basics about
[components anatomy](/theming#components-anatomy) and
[theming props](/theming#theming-props) as they still apply to
`@uploadthing/svelte`. However,
[content customization](/theming#content-customization) makes use of Svelte's
named slots and slot props.

### UploadButton content customization

```svelte
<UploadButton {uploader}>
  <span slot="button-content" let:state>
    {state.isUploading ? "Uploading..." : "Pick a file"}
  </span>
  <span slot="allowed-content" let:state>
    You can choose between {state.fileTypes.join(", ")} files
  </span>
</UploadButton>
```

### UploadDropzone content customization

```svelte
<UploadDropzone {uploader}>
  <i slot="upload-icon" let:state>
    <!-- some custom icon -->
  </i>
  <span slot="button-content" let:state>
    {state.isUploading ? "Uploading..." : "Pick a file"}
  </span>
  <span slot="label" let:state>
    {state.ready ? "Ready to upload" : "Loading..."}
  </span>
  <span slot="allowed-content" let:state>
    You can choose between {state.fileTypes.join(", ")} files
  </span>
</UploadDropzone>
```
